Object Model:

We need to be able to track the hits to each individual page within a site. The object model therefore looks like this:

   ----------------
   |     Site     |
   ----------------
   /       |       \ 
------   ------   ------
|Page|	 |Page|   |Page|
------   ------   ------

Each Site has many Page objects that belong to it. This relationship goes as such: a Site has many Pages, and a Page belongs to one Site. This model allows us to record the hits to each individual page
